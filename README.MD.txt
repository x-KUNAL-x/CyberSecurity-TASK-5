
ðŸ”¹ 1. Install Wireshark
Download from: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html

Install it on your computer like any other software.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Start Capturing Network Traffic
Here's how to do it:
Open Wireshark.

You'll see a list of network interfaces (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.).

Click on the active one (usually Wi-Fi if you're on a laptop).

Wireshark will now start capturing live traffic!
I USE MY ETHERNET

ðŸ”¹ 3. Generate Some Traffic
To capture meaningful data:

Open a browser and visit 2-3 websites like:
https://example.com, https://wikipedia.org

Or open CMD/Terminal and run:

nginx
Copy
Edit
ping google.com
Do this for about 1 minute.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Stop the Capture
In Wireshark, click the red square button to stop the capture.

Now youâ€™ll see lots of data (packets) captured.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Filter by Protocol
Letâ€™s make things clear by filtering the view:

In the filter bar at the top, type protocols like:

http â†’ shows only HTTP packets

dns â†’ shows only DNS packets

tcp â†’ shows TCP packets

udp â†’ shows UDP packets


ðŸ”¹ 6. Identify at Least 3 Protocols
Look for and note these protocols:

DNS â€“ used to look up website names (like google.com)

HTTP/HTTPS â€“ website traffic

TCP/UDP â€“ how data is sent

ICMP â€“ used for ping

ðŸ”¹ 7. Export the Capture
Now save your work:

Go to File > Export Specified Packets

Save it as KUNAL_task5.pcap

ðŸ”¹ 8. Write a Short Report

Wireshark Traffic Analysis Report â€“ Task 5

Date: [02/06/25]
Tool Used: Wireshark
Duration of Capture: 1 minute

Protocols Identified:

DNS â€“ Used to resolve domain names.

HTTP â€“ For browsing websites.

TCP â€“ Transmission protocol for web traffic.

Interesting Observations:

Saw several DNS queries when visiting websites.

HTTP requests show which pages I accessed.

TCP established connections with servers.

Conclusion:
This task helped me understand how protocols work when I browse the internet, and how Wireshark can be used to troubleshoot or study network behavior.
